# HTML and CSS Basics

# What is HTML?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It defines the structure and content of a webpage using a variety of elements and tags.

# How to Create an HTML Page

Creating an HTML page involves using a text editor to write HTML code and saving the file with a .html extension. The basic structure of an HTML document includes a <!DOCTYPE> declaration, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

# What is a Markup Language?

A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. HTML is a markup language used for structuring content on the web.

# What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of nodes, allowing programs to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a webpage.

# What is an Element / Tag?

In HTML, an element or tag is a basic building block used to define the structure and content of a webpage. Elements are enclosed within angle brackets (<>) and consist of a tag name and optional attributes.

# What is an Attribute?

An attribute provides additional information about an HTML element and is specified within the opening tag of the element. Attributes typically consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=).

# How Does the Browser Load a Webpage?

When a browser loads a webpage, it sends a request to the web server hosting the page, retrieves the HTML content, parses the HTML to construct the DOM, fetches external resources such as CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files, and renders the webpage.

# What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It defines the visual appearance and layout of elements on a webpage.

# How to Add Style to an Element

To add style to an HTML element, you can use CSS properties and values within a <style> element in the document's <head> section, or link an external CSS stylesheet using the <link> element.

# What is a Class?

A class is a reusable identifier that can be applied to one or more HTML elements to associate them with a specific style or behavior defined in CSS or JavaScript.

# What is a Selector?

A selector is a pattern used to select HTML elements to which a set of CSS rules should be applied. Selectors can target elements based on their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or relationship with other elements.

# How to Compute CSS Specificity Value

CSS specificity is a value that determines which CSS rules take precedence when multiple rules target the same element. Specificity is calculated based on the combination of selectors used in a CSS rule.

# What are Box Properties in CSS?

Box properties in CSS define the visual formatting model for elements on a webpage. They include properties such as width, height, margin, padding, border, and box-sizing, which control the size, spacing, and border of an element's box.
